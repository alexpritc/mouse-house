gdd reads as a set of features but not as a set of outputs that leads to a learn output
the learning/informing aspect is the justifaction for the focus of the features
the gamifcation of that information is kind of like a core pillar of the interaction of the world and output of the interaction

simulation, motivation, and learning

engagement - good behaviour in mobile games = weekly quests, daily quests, 
games for good
not only creating a sim thats fun but gamifcation to encourage regular engagement
rewards over time engaging to encourage players to engage longer
need to consider how to keep people there over time

- how long to be engaged for
- what do you expect people to learn
- how do mechanics lean into that
